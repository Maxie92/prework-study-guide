            <li>Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of each version of you project.</li>
            <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
            <li>git status: checks what brant we are currently on.</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
            <li>git add -A: adds code to the current working branch.</li>
            <li>git commit with a commit message: allows files to be commited with a description of what is being committed.</li>
            <li>git pull origin main: allows you to pull down any changes from the main branch. This is an important step for insuring you are working on the latest version.</li>
            <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: pushes changes to the remote branch.</li>
            <li>Create a pull request. Remembering to add a title and descriptive description of what was changed.</li>
            <li>No coding should be done directly into the main branch.</li>
            <li>Creating new branches allows team members to work indepentantly on different areas of the code. These branches are known as feature branches.</li>
            <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working.</li>
            <li>Remember to add detailed descriptions of the code that was changed.</li>
            <li>We will the push up changes to the GitHub Repository. This will still be in out featured branch and not in our main branch.</li>
            <li>A pull request (PR) is used to merge our feature branch (camparison branch) into the base branch.</li>
            <li>The base branch is where the changes will be merged into the main branch.</li>
            <li>Once the PR is opened, team members will be able to view and comment on your changes.</li>
            <li>Once the PR is approved, it can be merged into the main branch.
              From this point on any changes made will be done from a branch from this updated main branch.</li>
